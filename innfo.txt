In the servers we have made so far it is only a one way connection where the server responds to the users request and can't
send anything to the user otherwise

Now let us take the example of chat application->
1.>Using polling (each users req the server if it has any msgs for it and if any sen it because the server can't initiate comm to deliver the msg)
        But Polling is overkill and increase the load on the server tremmendously.
        Now to solve this problem we have WEB SOCKETS
2.>It is bidirectional connection and maintains thet comms route b/w the server and the client so that both can communicate
        It is a bidirectional communication protocol
        we sent a http req and in its header upgrade it to web socket connection

**We make use of http module with express cuz we have to attach socket.io with the server and we can't directly listen
